It's basically a three (kind of four) step process.

You need to create a Metric Filter from your logs. 
This will allow you to create a metric whenever there is an "error" in your log (or whatever other condition you want). 
The name of the metric would typically be something like "Errors" for this case, but there is a namespace that is fully yours. 
In that spot you put something like "/my-organization/my-service" or whatever makes sense to you.


Create a Metric Alarm. This alarm is where you will specify what conditions trigger the alarm. For example, if there is 1 error in any 2 minutes. This alarm will be pointed at the new metric you created in the previous step.

Send the alarm to an SNS topic.
